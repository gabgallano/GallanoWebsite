								<h4 class="tm-history-title"><strong>History of our restaurant</strong></h4>
								<p class="tm-mb-p">In the bustling streets of Manila, there is a restaurant that has stood the test of time - <strong>"Lutong Bahay"</strong>. This restaurant has been around for over 50 years and is considered a classic Filipino dining experience.<br> The restaurant was founded in the early 1970s by a couple named Eduardo and Gloria. They had a passion for cooking and decided to turn their home-cooked meals into a business. The restaurant started small, with just a few tables and chairs in their living room. But word quickly spread about the delicious food being served, and soon, they had to expand to accommodate more customers. <br>At first, Lutong Bahay served only traditional Filipino dishes like adobo, sinigang, and kare-kare. But as time passed, they began to incorporate more modern Filipino cuisine into their menu. They also started to use more locally-sourced ingredients, which made their dishes even more authentic and flavorful. <br>Throughout the years, Lutong Bahay has become a beloved dining spot for both locals and tourists. Many famous Filipino celebrities and politicians have eaten at the restaurant, making it a staple in the Manila food scene. <br>Today, the restaurant is still owned and operated by Eduardo and Gloria's family. Although they have expanded to multiple locations throughout Manila, the original Lutong Bahay still holds a special place in their hearts. <br>As you step into the restaurant, you'll be greeted with warm smiles and the delicious aroma of Filipino food. From the classic adobo to the more modern dishes like sisig and lechon kawali, Lutong Bahay has something for everyone. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even try their exotic dishes like balut and isaw!

Lutong Bahay is not just a restaurant, it's a part of Filipino history. It's a testament to the passion and dedication of the Filipino people, and a reminder of the rich and vibrant culture that has been passed down from generation to generation.</p>
